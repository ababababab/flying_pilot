 Functionality Of Stack.(Using C Language)

          To Implement the PUSH/POP functionality of stack here we uses the concept of Linked List . 
In this program here we have 2 functions  A)push & B)pop .

A)void push(int data): This function first creates the memory for node then put the ‘data’ into ‘info’                        part of node and assign ‘NULL’to the link part of node. Then this node is joined                        with the last node of Linked List.

B)int pop() : This function returns the ‘info’ of last node & removes the last node form linked list.
              Output: 
   On console we have menu with 3 options
   1)push
   2)pop
   3)exit.
    Then asked for our choice.
=>If we press choice 1) then it will ask for number and that number will be pushed into the stack as      per the given condition.If condition is not satisfied then it will print appropriate message.

=>If we press choice 2) then it will print the ‘poped’ number and ‘pattern’ onto the console.

=>If we press choice 3) then programe will be terminated.
